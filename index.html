    <h2>Adam Schwartz</h2>
    <p>My name is Adam and I'm a college student at BYU-I. I grew up in Highland, Utah, a small town in the Wasatch Mountains.
    Growing up there has taught me a lot about the outdoors and the beauty of nature. I've been snowboarding ever since I was a kid,
    and I have a passion for it that I think will never go away. I also love to surf when I can and it's become another hobby of mine.
    Rock climbing is something I just started doing recently and I'm really enjoying it. It's great exercise and makes me appreciate the outdoors even more.</p>
    <p>In addition to the outdoor activities I do, I also love making videos. I find it to be a great outlet for my creativity and I love being able to make something that I can be proud of.
    I think it's important to find outlets for your creative side and I'm glad I've found something that I can enjoy.</p>
    <p>I served an LDS mission in Hawaii and it was an amazing experience. I got to learn more about the culture, the people and the Tongan language.
    It was also a great opportunity for me to work on my interpersonal skills and to grow as an individual.</p>
    <p>I'm excited to be in this class and hope to learn from all my classmates.</p>
